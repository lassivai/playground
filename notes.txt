dependency libraries probably should be statically linked

freeverb3 needed to be downloaded from browser, other dependency libraries from ubuntu repositories. And placed into a parent folder...

lodepng should be included in the project folder

libglew updated from 2.0 to 2.1

had custom sdl include folder name to distinguish different versions

chipmunk header dissapeared
//#include <chipmunk/chipmunk_structs.h>

include only dependencies (available from repos.)
 - eigen (matrices)
 - cereal (serialization)
