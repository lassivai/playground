Thinking about the new visualization I made, how much should there be frequencies/harmonics visible... The answer was already solved: max freq 10 000 Hz
I chose to have max freq 4000 or 5000 Hz with the note frequency 100 Hz because it yeilded 40 - 50 harmonics that could be visible in that small visualization.
Apprently the middle C (C4 or 261.63 Hz) yeilds comfortable 38 partials up to 10 000 Hz, so that would be more appropriate preview note.



pitch = S^(note-69) * 440
S^(note-69) * 440 = pitch
S^(note-69) = pitch / 440
log S^(note-69) = log(pitch / 440)
(note-69) * log S = log(pitch / 440)
(note-69) = log(pitch / 440) / log S
note = log(pitch / 440) / log S + 69


8.11.2018. Today I half-accidentally learned the coolest way to visualize sound. I got intrigued about a 2D oscilloscope kind device in a music recording studio, and I knew I just had to have it in my own synthesizer. Concidering how beautiful, simple and profound this way of visualizing stereo sound is, I am absolutely amazed I have never before seen this thing, and couldn't even find any info about this in google.

The simple formula for the trajectory:
x(t) = left_out(t) - right_out(t)
y(t) = left_out(t) + right_out(t)

I am not 100 % sure if that formula I discovered/created is the one that was shown in that studio machine...

Need to think the following though with time, but the nature of sound is giving me headache now. In a good way.

What do you hear when you hear really low-pitched note? Something like 8 Hz for instance?
You can hear the individual kind of "pulses" which make up all the higher notes, but can you really
hear the lower note itself? Am I only hearing the pulses which, as far as I can hear, consist of some higher
pitched note itself? To me this seems excatly like a fractal. Then one could zoom into those individual pulse
notes, only to find similar pulses within.

I think I am able to demonstrate with my synth that this isn't that mysterious after all, but I found that still a fun thought.
