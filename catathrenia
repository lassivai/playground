MEDICAL EXPERIMENT GOING ON. BEWARE OF DISTURBING SOUNDS.

I suffer from psychosomatic parasomnia called catathrenia, which actualizes as tortured
and disturbed sounds. It is probably associated with feeling anxiety through my sleep.
It started already 20 years ago, but nowadays the truman show makes it all the worse...
I can't hear it but I need to understand more, that's why I am recording it.
