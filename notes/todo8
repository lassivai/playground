TODO
- seperate note class into 3 smaller classes:
  - synthesis notes (DONE)
  - recorded notes (partially DONE)
  - sequencer notes (partially DONE)
- I need some sort of hash association to the recorded note from other notes
 - lot of boring work today (and days to come maybe), but the sequencer will work so much smoother after this: for example no need to record every single note, but one instance of similar pitch and length notes can be shared
Renaming part behind. Then I need a new note recording system for the sequencer notes.

/\ now this /\ (will take several days maybe - with so many things made unusable at the same time, and the success depending on the new working parts, this feels like trying to jump over very wide abyss, lot of debugging follows. Scariest part behind.)

- cool features coming later
  - drawing of a synth beat by 2D spectrum map
   - external 2D grayscale image or even video could be applied also
  - drawing of a synth beat by 2D stereo-oscilloscope line figure
  - automation or keyframe based aural "animation" for instrument parameters (similar as that fractal animation in visual form)
  
- save/load song files
   - including used instruments
- before opening instrument, check if identical instrument already exists
- next boring and big challenge, instead of song file input/output, same stuff for the whole session, including the song and all the other parameters
- select group of notes, move an copy and paste
- move view window according to progression of track (DONE)
- change note vector to list

Sin bands needs to manage higher notes with high partials. The unmanaged problem is that higher frequency partials fold back from the frequency sampleRate/2.
 - perhaps own wavetable for each octave

FIXME
- ahe envelope offset cause clicks sometimes... (FIXED)
- lines and rect strokes sometimes dissapear. Started after put fast stroke renderers at few spots (partially FIXED)
   - title bar line dissapears from note biquad filter panel if fast stroke renderer used at envelope preview panel......
   - but appears simultaneously with blinking text cursir in one certain text box
   - if fast stroke renderer applied at the weak spot, it works, original bug still haunts, yet not visible anywhere
   - 31.8.2019. Halted 3 times at startup (had alsa instead of jack this time, because of halted jack server! ...this should explain all)
   
----

I am starting to be pleased with the appearance of that thing. I was thinking to make it look like a controlling panel from the manned moon flight era.
