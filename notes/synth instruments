Probably can't achieve perfect piano for all the key range with this setup, because the harmonic content is so pitch dependent.

One day I might make it possible to create pitch dependent waveform, but not any time soon. Unless I get asperger boost. I might have got it.

I have created these instruments using sampling rate 96000 Hz, which makes that aliasing problem go away, but now I am making these instruments aliasing free with a more normal sampling rate 44100 Hz.

Fixing instruments
          Anti-aliasing   Volume
keys      X               X
leads     X               -
accord.   X               -
organs    X               -

Can't tell if you had similar audio mixing as I did... Very silent those "loud" sounds over here.

Currently "just playing" and experimenting possible future directions for the synth, and whatever already possible to synthesize with this synth.

Found one missing thing, I think, a compressor, which would make it possible to have overall louder stuff. Because it would reduce the dynamic range. Now when I have a lot of notes playing the volume reaches the maximum number, but single notes are far from it. With compressor everything could be louder, because the multinote places would be compressed.
