TODO

- lot of memory optimization to be done
  - especially in instrument class
    - especially in waveform class
      - apparently sin bands associated tables are the main culprit
      
- maybe get rid of some of the wave shapes
- compressor
- copy/paste voice/modulator/envelope (in addition to swap)
(DONE!)
- precalculate filter parameters for note/voice filters
  - perpaps 1000 samples etc.
- fixed note frequency (DONE)

Sin bands
 - instead of convolving the whole array, add impulse responses to the points of partials
 - different forms of impulse responses
   - power slopes on either side (variable width on both sides)

anti-aliasing problem solved!
