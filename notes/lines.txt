16.9.2019 playground project contains 72327 lines by my own hand. If put into a book 50 lines per page, I would have written 1446.54 pages of code in 2018 and 2019.

In other words this is the biggest project of my entire life. During the years I have been aware of the Truman show (2016-), another huge success story was learning to play violin (so much work still to do, of course), but I concider this probably even bigger success in the absurd non-privacy situation as this has involved so huge amount of creativity and involvement.

(it contains several novel fractal engines (some products you can see most of the time playing on my desktop), physics sandbox, synthesizer, midi sequencer, sound recorder, mp3 player...)

When I get my freedom, I am planning to continue my studies, which would most probably be biotechnology. Doing engineering is probably my truest calling.

#FREEDOM_2020























Hard to believe I have built this thing (software synthesizer) from scratch. It took about a full year. Many days 8-10 hours of coding. Never played with a synth which fits my needs better.

The days of my current year have been like running through the fog. As I have let you know several times my mind has been kind of "controlled by a woodoo zombie". Not nice!

With the exception of the last month as I have just relaxed mostly, I have been just as hard working most of the year as most of my life before.
