Playground TODO/FIXME
- every action in the form of command line commands
- possibility to invoke those together, and even from a script file
- flame experiment causes a gui bug (FIXED!)
- seperate spectrum trasform for the graph and map (DONE!)
- the spectrums still don't match on the screen if not integer multiple of each other (FIXED!)
- annoying blinking in the spectrum (better fit of frame time and spectrum transform length)
- option to choose between left/right/stereo/combined waveform/envelope/spectrums
- mandelbrot multisampling (progressively in the background) (DONE!)
 - next time with automation :)
- waveform and envelope speed control (as a time window which is visible on the screen)
- more precise and adaptive note recognition from spectrum, especially from the lower end
  - integration, curve fit, local maxs/mins...
- something wrong with the variable binding (-Wall and stuff)
- field for parent gui element, double click close panels

I need to start experimenting with weirder sounds. I wonder what mandelbrot set would sound like turned into audio instead of pixels... Have to finish that todo list first. Not today.
