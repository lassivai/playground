Todo
- volumetric ray-tracing (start this thing today, get the code from the cell rendering app) (DONE)
 - one thing I have dreamed for a long time would be 3D fractals, this will allow certain kind of those, and also other cool 3D effects,
   next I need to implement that ray tracer with GPU (video card) to get interactive experience with decent resolution (DONE)
 - I am pretty sure that flame fractal method could be extended into 3 dimensions very easily, don't really know how it will look like, but very exciting (DONE)
  - this is why I have avoided 3D stuff, the math of 3D geometry isn't linearly harder than that of 2D, but more like exponentially
  - for example that julia thing works in 2D by choosing randomly whether to turn 90 degrees left or right, but in 3D...
- the song editor mode, save/load songs
- different kind of audio tracks
  - midi kind
  - recorded
- easy to use looper so I could control it, for example, with just a pedal in a kind of performance mode
- I would need so much more synth instruments
- I would like to have a feature that I could prototype algortihmic sounds (other than what I can do with my existing modular/additive/substractive/FM synth) without having to compile, or even restart the program. I was thinking to do try to synthesize sound with GPU (video card), because that code can be reloaded during program runtime. Those would not be low-latency enough for realtime playing, but rather some soundscapes, or possibly for realtime playing by recording samples for each note frequency
- this engine I have been doing is very incomplete in many ways, the rendering engine should handle big data much better. I should study the newest methods of rendering huge amount of polygons with the current state of graphics hardware. I need 3D. Soon.
  - I get motivated to take care of this kinf of fundamental building blocks of programs, by having applications where to apply it at once. I have for a long time wanted to create
    a molecular visualization software. I think I'll start with that
- better compilation method. Start using .cpp files for precompiled code? Precompile headers?
- universal keyframe animation interface for fractals, scene3D...
- 3D textures instead of 2D arrays
- change coding editor?

Everything I am writing about coding is "todo", building more and more tools for the future, but let's have a list of completed stuff
- here is a modification of a so called julia fractal flame, kind of which I haven't never seen, and I feel this is my favourite fractal currently,
  exceptionally plentiful
- I am very happy how the transition of that voxel raytracer has gone from the bioimaging software to this playground
